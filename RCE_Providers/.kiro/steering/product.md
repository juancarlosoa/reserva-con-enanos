# Product Overview

RCE Providers is a REST API service for managing escape room providers and their rooms. The system allows for:

- Managing escape room provider information (name, contact details)
- Managing rooms associated with each provider
- Automatic slug generation for SEO-friendly URLs
- Provider-room relationships with cascade deletion

The API is designed to support a larger escape room ecosystem, likely serving as a backend for booking or directory services.
